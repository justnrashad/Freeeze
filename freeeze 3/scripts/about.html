                <p>
                  Stop into any our ice cream parlor or peak inside the case at the supermarket, 
                  and you will witness the expansive array of flavors, from traditional vanilla 
                  and coffee ice creams to somewhat unusual flavors such as sweet basil and sweet 
                  potato. But when it comes to gelato, the flavor profile is much more narrow. 
                  There are a few classics you'll find in gelato form—vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, 
                  and stracciatella (vanilla with crunchy chocolate pieces), as well as pistachio, 
                  tiramisu, and a variety of fruit flavors—but not necessarily the type of combinations 
                  you see in the ice cream aisle.
  
                  The differences in both treats' compositions and the way they are stored affect the 
                  way they taste and feel in your mouth. Fat coats the tongue, creating a layer between 
                  the taste buds and the food you are eating, and colder food numbs the tongue a bit, 
                  making it more difficult to actually taste the food. Since gelato has less fat and 
                  is warmer than ice cream, the flavors come through more and are more intense. 
                  These factors also make for a smoother consistency whereas ice cream has more of a 
                  fine crystal texture.
